### This repository contains a template for a Telegram bot built with Python and aiogram. It's designed to provide a structured and scalable starting point for developing Telegram bots.

## Features 🌟

- **Modular Design** 🔧: The project is structured into modules for commands, message handlers, states (FSM), utilities, and more, making it easy to expand and maintain.
- **Command Handling** 📜: Separate modules for different command handlers, allowing for clean and organized command implementation.
- **State Management** 🔄: Included support for Finite State Machines (FSM) for complex conversation flows.
- **Utilities and Helpers** 🛠️: Dedicated module for utility functions and helpers to keep the codebase clean and DRY.
- **Keyboard Layouts** ⌨️: Organized inline and reply keyboard layouts for easy management.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `bot.py`: Main entry point for the bot.
- `config.py`: Configuration settings and environment variable management.
- `handlers/`: Command and message handlers.
  - `commands/`: Handlers for specific bot commands.
  - `messages/`: Handlers for message-based interactions.
- `states/`: State definitions for FSM.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `keyboards/`: Inline and reply keyboard layouts.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create and update .env file with your bot token and other settings
    - TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN
    - DATABASE_URL
    - Other secret information
4. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

> **Note on Virtual Environments:**  
> If you're using a virtual environment (which is highly recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python projects), activate it before installing the dependencies. Here's how you can set up and activate a virtual environment:
> ```bash
> python -m venv venv
> # For Windows
> .\venv\Scripts\activate
> # For Unix or MacOS
> source venv/bin/activate
> ```
